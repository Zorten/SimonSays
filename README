#Simon Says
This is my project for a "Simon Says" game, which I implemented on a breadboard with the ATMEGA 1284P-PU Microcontroller, an LED Matrix, some buttons and a Pulse Width Modulator.
The LED Matrix is used to represent four quadrants, which are mapped to four buttons. When the program is started, the quadrants flash until the player presses any of the buttons. 
After starting, the game will begin by lighting up a quadrant and making a sound with a pitch unique to that quadrant. The player must press the button corresponding to that quadrant. 
The game will then continue, increasing the number of quadrants that light up and the player must mimic, up to a total of 5 rounds, at which the game ends and the player wins. 
If the player wins, all four quadrants will flash and play a celebratory tune, after which the game will reset and wait on user input to begin.
If at any point the player gets a button wrong, the game will reset and wait for user input. 

Here's a video where I explain and show the game: https://youtu.be/1ropaDxx7X0
